There are devices,
d1,d2,d3.. dn
There are static hubs  h1,h2, hn


whenever a device d1 enters radius r1 of h1 it should trigger loginevent and if goes out should emit logoutevent.

assuming 8k events per seconds device such a system.

suggested kafka based approach but got cofused on timestamp based consumption.
scenariouls if events are coming out of order.



There are millions of Customer and transactions happening
design a transacation management system.
